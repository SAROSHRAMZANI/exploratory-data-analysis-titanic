# 🧊 Titanic EDA Task 2

## 📘 Description
This project explores the classic **Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster** dataset.  
The goal is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** — cleaning the data, handling missing values, generating insights, and visualizing survival patterns using Python.

---

## 🧩 Key Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values for `Age` and `Embarked`.
   - Dropped irrelevant columns such as `Cabin` (if present).

2. **Feature Understanding**
   - Analyzed data types and generated summary statistics.

3. **Group-Based Insights**
   - Calculated survival rates by gender and passenger class.

4. **Data Visualization**
   - Created bar plots and heatmaps to visualize patterns and correlations.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – for data cleaning and analysis  
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – for data visualization  
- **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook** – for execution and exploration  

---

## 📊 Visuals Included
- Survival Rate by Gender  
- Survival Rate by Passenger Class  
- Correlation Heatmap (Numeric + Encoded Features)

## 📁 Dataset
Dataset used: [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**.  
2. Upload the Titanic dataset file (`train.csv`) from Kaggle.  
3. Run each cell step by step to reproduce the results.
